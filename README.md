# Newtonian Gravity
Simple Newtonian gravity simulator I made a while back

Controls:
  - Click to create object, click again to set it off (arrow shows direction and magnitude of velocity)
  -  Scroll to change mass of object
  - G to toggle gravity
  - C to toggle collision
  - B to toggle a bounding box (at edges  of screen)
  - Del to delete last placed object
  - End to delete all objects
  
Don't press:
  - L locks mouse to centre of screen (rotates screen in 3D mode)
  - T 3D debugging mode which does not properly work yet
  
Todo:
  Combine this and my 3D renderer to make a proper 3D mode.
